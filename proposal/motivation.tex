Haskell is a cutting edge functional programming language:
it produces clean and concise code;
its expressive type system force documented and correct programs; 
its purity allows native concurrency and 
it provides higher performance than many mainstream languages (like Java or C++). 


Though, formal verification of Haskell source code has been cumbersome.
Haskell supports verification via dependent types, which requires  
major code modification (ie., lifting expressions to types)
and explicit proofs.
% Both these features render verification with dependent types cumbersome [hazohism].
%

The goal of my research project is to combine Haskell's type system with 
the power of SMT solvers to 
create a next-generation verifier for Haskell.
%
A key feature of this verifier is  \textit{usability}:
the specification language should be simple and 
verification should require minimum code modifications and annotations. 
%
Finally, since Haskell has been a prototype for mainstream programming languages,
hopefully, this type of verification could be 
integrated to standard application development chain.
